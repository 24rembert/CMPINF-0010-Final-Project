CMPINF 0010 Final Project

Team 29. BFL

Our final project looks into the worst Pittsburgh neighborhood. We use the Firearms.csv, Fire Incidents.csv and trees.csv datasets to determine this.

Note: Personal notebooks are not included due to issues with geopandas on the crc. We each wrote code in seperate python files and compiled it together in the notebook presented in this git.
