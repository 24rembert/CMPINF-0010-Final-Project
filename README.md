Datasets:
Pittsburgh Police Firearm Seizures - http://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pbp-fire-arm-seizures
Each Pittsburgh Police Firearm Seizures. Used to calculate the "saftey" of each neighborhood.

Fire Incidents - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02
Each Pittsburgh Fire Incident. Used to calculate the "fire saftey" of the neighborhood. 

City Trees - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da
Every Tree in Pittsburgh. Used to calculate the total surface area of greenery in Pittsburgh per neighborhood. 

Our final project looks into the worst Pittsburgh neighborhood. We use the Firearms.csv, Fire Incidents.csv and trees.csv datasets to determine this. Compliation and data analysis is done in the 'FinalProjectGroup29.ipynb' jupyter notebook file.

Note: Personal notebooks are not included due to issues with geopandas on the crc. We each wrote code in seperate python files and compiled it together in the notebook presented in this git.
